					<p>Much of our community life happens in Growth Groups. These are small groups centered on Godâ€™s word, prayer, and deep relationships. They exist to help people grow as disciples of Jesus, give people spiritual families to lean into, and bring the love of Jesus to the neighborhoods in which they meet.</p>

					<p>Most of our Growth Groups gather weekly in homes and apartment complexes throughout Norman. If you would like know more about these groups and how to get involved in one, please contact Matthew Beasley at matthewhenrybeasley@gmail.com.</p>
