      - Much of our community life happens in Growth Groups.
      - These are small groups centered on God&rsquo;s word, prayer, and deep relationships.
      - They exist to help people grow as disciples of Jesus, give people spiritual families to lean into, and bring the love of Jesus to the neighborhoods in which they meet.
    -
      - Most of our Growth Groups gather weekly in homes and apartment complexes throughout Norman.
      - If you would like know more about these groups and how to get involved in one, please contact Matthew Beasley at matthewhenrybeasley@gmail.com.
