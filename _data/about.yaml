our_story:
  -
    - We are a community of people committed to glorifying God as disciples of Jesus Christ.
    - We planted in 2017 to preach the gospel where Christ isn&rsquo;t already known throughout Norman in multi-housing communities, neighborhoods, and on campus.
  -
    - We are a church plant of Christ Community Church, Oklahoma City.
    - Since 2010, they have been faithfully serving Jesus in Southwest Oklahoma City.
    - Their model of settling in neighborhoods, starting evangelistic Bible studies, raising up disciples, and working to see God's kingdom transform all aspects of community life is written into our DNA.
    - We are their first church plant and the start of a network of like-hearted and like-minded local churches.
  -
    - We long for the gospel to spread in Norman.
    - Our desire is for our neighbors, friends, and family to know Christ and live as his disciples.
